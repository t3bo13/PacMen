# PacMen

This repository contains an HTML project that showcases a simple Pac-Man animation using CSS animations and JavaScript.

## Project Overview

The Pac-Man Exercise is a fun and interactive web page that displays a Pac-Man character moving across the screen and changing directions upon hitting the screen edges. The animation gives the illusion of Pac-Man eating pellets and moving around like in the classic arcade game.
